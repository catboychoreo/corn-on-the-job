## ðŸŒ½ About Corn on the Job
Corn on the Job is a job search application for students attending Ruston High School. The website is designed to support three different types of users, including students, employers, and administrators. At Corn on the Job, our goal is to connect students with meaningful career opportunities by providing a user-friendly platform that makes the job search process simple, efficient, and accessible. We aim to **nurture** growth, **empower** talent, and **help individuals find their perfect job**, *one kernel at a time*.

## Student Features
A student account may view approved job postings and apply for jobs. On applying, the employer will recieve application information. 

(The current login for a student account is Username: student and Password: student)

## Employer Features
An employer account may view approved job postings and post their own. They'll include a job title, a description of the job, a company name and logo, alongside an email address to recieve applications. The submitted job listing will then be sent to review by an admin account. An employer account may not apply for jobs.

(The current login for an employer account is Username: employer and Password: employer)

## Admin Features
An admin account holds the most power over COTJ. They have access to a backend panel with the permission to approve or delete pending job postings from employers. In addition, the admin view of the home page includes the ability to delete job postings previously approved. An admin account may not apply for jobs.
